Here you can find my implementation for the Turjuman Machine Translation Toolkit to an online webpage using Gradio and Hugging Face Spaces, link: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ahmedoumar/TurjumanTranslation

Turjuman is a recent neural machine translation toolkit. It translates from 20 languages into Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Turjuman is described in this paper: TURJUMAN: A Public Toolkit for Neural Arabic Machine Translation.

Turjuman exploits our AraT5 model. This endows Turjuman with a powerful ability to decode into Arabic. The toolkit offers the possibility of employing a number of diverse decoding methods, making it suited for acquiring paraphrases for the MSA translations as an added value.
